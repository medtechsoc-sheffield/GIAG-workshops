Materials for give it a go workshop run on 8th October 2018 at Sheffield University

We use repl.it python environment to facilitate a quick start to coding due to short time of the session.

There are several versions of the script, the participants are given a commented python script, with only a few key lines. During the lesson they fill the functions and make a working game with the help of instructors live-coding.
